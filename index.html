      "Your ability to hype up seemingly banal chores into major events, your
      ability to continuously keep them at the forefront of conversation, and
      your overall execution, filming, and relaying of events never ceases to
      amaze and inspire me. Your ceaseless drive to create content, generate
      conversation, and lay the groundwork for future interactions is a credit
      to both you and your ability to rise above the many challenges you have
      faced in life. I'm honored and proud to call you my friend and I wish you
      all the best luck in the coming yard work."
